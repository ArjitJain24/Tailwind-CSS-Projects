# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Nike Frontend Clone
This project is a frontend clone of the Nike website, created using Tailwind CSS and React JS. The application is designed to replicate the look and feel of the original Nike site, featuring various sections such as popular products, special offers, and customer reviews.
